**Expanse(J)** is a pure-Java implementation of the Expanse protocol.
It is provided as a library that can be embedded in any Java/Scala project and
to provide full support for Expanse protocol and sub-services.
Expanse(J) was first developed by
`Roman Mandeleil <https://github.com/romanman>`_ and is now sponsored
by `<ether.camp> <http://www.ether.camp>`_.

Expanse(J) supports CPU mining.  It is currently implemented in pure Java
and can be used in private and test networks. You may even mine on the
live Expanse network, even though it is not economically feasible.
