Installing binaries
================================================================================

The cpp-expanse development team and the broader Expanse community publish
binary releases in many different forms for a variety of platforms.   This
aims to be a complete list of those releases.

If you are aware of other third-party packaging efforts, please let us know on
the `cpp-expanse gitter channel <http://gitter.im/expanse/cpp-expanse>`_,
and we will add them to this list.
