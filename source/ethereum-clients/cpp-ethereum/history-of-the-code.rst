History of the code
################################################################################

The `C++ Expanse project <http://github.com/expanse-org/webthree-umbrella>`_ was
initiated by `Gavin Wood <http://gavwood.com/>`_, the
`former CTO <https://blog.expanse.org/2016/01/11/last-blog-post/>`_ of the
Expanse Foundation, in December 2013.   It is the second most popular of the
clients, trailing a long way behind the dominant `geth <https://github.com/expanse-org/go-expanse>`_ client,
also built by the Expanse Foundation.

Many of the original C++ developers moved on to roles at
`Slock.it <http://slock.it>`_ and `Ethcore <http://ethcore.io>`_ in
late 2015 and early 2016 following a
`75% cut in funding <https://blog.expanse.org/2016/01/07/2394/>`_ for C++
development.  Those cuts were part of a broader effort to bring Foundation
costs under control, and they happened prior to the recent spike in ETH
value which has put the Foundation in a much more comfortable financial
position.

for the full list of everybody who has worked on the code.
