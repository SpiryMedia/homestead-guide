The Expanse Foundation
***************************************************
The Expanse Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, and has the purpose of managing the funds that were raised from the Expanse Sale in order to best serve the Expanse and decentralized technology ecosystem.

Founded July 2014 in Switzerland, Stiftung Expanseâ€™s mission is the promotion of developments of new technologies and applications, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software architectures.

It is the aim that decentralized and open technologies will be developed, nurtured, promoted and maintained. A dominating, but not exclusive, focus is set on the promotion of the development of the Expanse Protocol and the relevant technology to it as well as the promotion and support of applications using the Expanse technology or protocol. Stiftung Expanse will additionally support and advocate for a decentralized Internet in a variety of forms.
