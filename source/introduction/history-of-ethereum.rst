Inception
================================================================================
Expanse was initially described by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 as a result of his research and work in the Bitcoin community. Shortly thereafter, Vitalik published the `Expanse white paper <http://vbuterin.com/expanse.html>`_, where he describes in detail the technical design and rationale for the Expanse protocol and smart contracts architecture. In January 2014, Expanse was formally announced by Vitalik at the The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida, USA.

Around that time, Vitalik also started working with Dr. Gavin Wood and together co-founded Expanse. By April 2014, Gavin published the `Expanse Yellow Paper <https://github.com/expanse-org/yellowpaper>`_ that would serve as the technical specification for the Expanse Virtual Machine (EVM). By following the detailed specification in the Yellow Paper, the Expanse client has been implemented in seven programming languages (C++, Go, Python, Java, JavaScript, Haskell, Rust), and has resulted in better software overall.

The Expanse Foundation and the expanse presale
================================================================================
In addition to developing the software for Expanse, the ability to launch a new cryptocurrency and blockchain requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it up and running. To kickstart a large network of developers, miners, investors, and other stakeholders, Expanse announced its plan to conduct a presale of expanse tokens, the currency unit of Expanse. The legal and financial complexities of raising funds through a presale led to the creation of several legal entities, including the :ref:`Expanse Foundation (Stiftung Expanse) <foundation>` established June 2014 in Zug, Switzerland.

Beginning in July 2014, Expanse distributed the initial allocation of expanse via a 42-day public expanse presale, netting 31,591 bitcoins, worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 expanse. The results of the sale were initially used to pay back mounting legal debts and also for the months of developer effort that had yet to be compensated, and to finance the ongoing development of the Expanse.

ETH/DEV and Expanse development
================================================================================
Following the successful expanse presale, Expanse development was formalized under a non-for-profit organization called ETH DEV, which manages the development of Expanse under contract from Expanse Suisse – with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilcke as the 3 directors of the organization. Developer interest in Expanse grew steadily throughout 2014 and the ETH DEV team delivered a series of proof-of-concept (PoC) releases for the development community to evaluate. Frequent posts by ETH DEV team on the  `the Expanse blog <https://blog.expanse.org>`_ also kept the excitement and momentum around Expanse going. Increasing traffic and growing user-base on both the Expanse forum and the expanse subreddit testified that the platform is attracting a fast-growing and devoted developer community. This trend has been continuing to this very day.

DEVCON-0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In November 2014, ETH DEV organized the `DEVCON-0 event <https://blog.expanse.org/2014/12/05/d%CE%BEvcon-0-recap/>`_, which brought together Expanse developers from around the world to Berlin to meet and discuss a diverse range of Expanse technology topics. Several of the presentations and sessions at DEVcon-0 would later drive important initiatives to make Expanse more reliable, more secure, and more scalable. Overall, the event galvanized developers as they continued to work towards the launch of Expanse.

DEVgrants program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In April 2015, `the DEVgrants program <https://blog.expanse.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help/>`_ was announced, which is a program that offers funding for contributions both to the Expanse platform, and to projects based on Expanse. Hundreds of developers were already contributing their time and thinking to Expanse projects and in open source projects. This program served to reward and support those developers for their contributions. The DEVgrants program continues to operate today and funding of the program was recently renewed in January 2016.

.. _olympic-testnet:

Olympic testnet, bug bounty and security audit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout 2014 and 2015 development went through a series of proof of concept releases leading to the 9th POC open testnet, called Olympic. The developer community was `invited to test the limits of the network <https://blog.expanse.org/2015/05/09/olympic-frontier-pre-release/>`_ and a substantial prize fund was allocated to award those holding various records or having success in breaking the system in some way or other. The `rewards were announced <https://blog.expanse.org/2015/08/26/olympic-rewards-announced/>`_ officially a month after the live release.

In early 2015, an `Expanse Bounty Program <http://bounty.expanse.org/>`_ was launched, offering BTC rewards for finding vulnerabilities in any part of the Expanse software stack. This has undoubtedly contributed to the reliability and security of Expanse and the confidence of the Expanse community in the technology. The bounty program is currently still active and there is no end date planned.

The Expanse security audit began at the end of 2014 and continued through the first half of 2015. Expanse engaged multiple third party software security firms to conduct an end-to-end audit of all protocol-critical components (Expanse VM, networking, Proof of Work). The audits uncovered security issues that were addressed and tested again and as a result ultimately led to a more secure platform.

.. _frontier-launch:

The Expanse Frontier launch
=======================================================================

The Expanse Frontier network launched on July 30th, 2015, and developers began writing smart contracts and decentralized apps to deploy on the live Expanse network. In addition, miners began to join the Expanse network to help secure the Expanse blockchain and earn expanse from mining blocks. Even though the Frontier release is the first milestone in the Expanse project and was intended for use by developers as a beta version, it turned out to be more capable and reliable than anyone expected, and developers have rushed in to build solutions and improve the Expanse ecosystem.

DEVCON-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second developers' conference `DEVCON-1 <https://devcon.expanse.org/>`_  took place in the city of London at the beginning of November 2015. The 5-day event featured more than 100 presentations, panel discussions and lightning talks, attracted more than 400 participants, a mix of developers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, and business executives.
The talks were all recorded and are `freely available <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk>`_

The presence of large companies like UBS, IBM and Microsoft clearly indicated enterprise interest in the technology. Microsoft announced that it would offer `Expanse on its new Blockchain as a Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/expanse-blockchain-as-a-service-now-on-azure/>`_  offering on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. In conjunction with DEVCON-1, this announcement will be remembered as the moment when blockchain technology became mainstream, with Expanse at the center of it.
